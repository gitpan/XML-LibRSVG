XML::LibRSVG
============

This module is an interface to the gnome librsvg library.

At the moment it is a toy. The api is *very* likely to change 
at any time.

However it does work, allowing you to generate PNG's from SVG
files. Which is quite a neat hack in itself.

INSTALLATION

You're on your own getting librsvg working. Whatever route you
choose (I used ximian gnome), if you use RPM's make sure you
also have the -devel RPMs of everything.

PREREQUISITES

Things this requires:

gtk+ 1.2
gdk
gdk-pixbuf
libart
freetype
libpng
librsvg

And working config scripts for each (i.e. gdk-pixbuf-config 
must work). Except libpng, which doesn't have a config script.
